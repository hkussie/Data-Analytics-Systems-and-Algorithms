# Data-Analytics-Systems-and-Algorithms
Exploration of fundamental concepts, constructs, and techniques of modern data analytics systems (CPTS 215 WSU)

This repository includes various projects created using RStudio while taking Computer Science 215 (Data Analytics Systems and Algorithms). 
This course focused on the use of data analytics and common algorithms that are used to manipulate large data sets. The algorithms and techniques 
that are used in these projects are done so to extract information regarding the relationship between different variables to establish weather or 
not a correlation exists. Methods used to examine these relationships include: Cross-Validation, Confidence Interval Tests, T-Tests, and Multiple 
Regression Models among others. The data used in these models is from an original non-machine learning study entitled: "The Population Biology of 
Abalone from the North Coast and Islands of Bass Strait." The authors of this study sought to measure the physical measurements of male, female, 
and infant Abalones and examine potential correlation relationships between various data points.
